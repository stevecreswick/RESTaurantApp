#RESTaurant Ordering App

## About

I focused on the information hierarchy and user experience of the application rather than on having too many distracting animation.  Using it is pretty intuitive and most information is accessible, but hidden in ways that do not clutter up the screen or menu bars.

### Unsolved Promblems
In future iterations I will have the ability to add employees, and add another layer of sales performance display.

### User Stories

- As a waiter, I can activate a table and start an order with one click so I can put in orders faster

- As a waiter, I can select multiple items and multiple quantities on the same page so I can put in orders faster

- As a waiter, I can see all of my active tables and get to their receipt or close their check quickly

- As a waiter, unavailable items are blocked off so I do not accidentally click on something that has been 86'ed

- As a manager I can make an item unvailable quickly

- As a manager I can quickly add items to the menu

- As a manager I have all the information I need in one panel

- As a chef I can see when items are taking too long

- As a chef I can quickly clear an item once it comes up
